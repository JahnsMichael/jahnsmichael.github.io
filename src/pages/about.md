My name is **Jahns Michael**. You can call me **Jahns** or **Michael**.
I’m currently studying **Computer Science** at **Universitas Indonesia**.
I have so much interests for *Software Development* in general, but spesifically
*Front End Development*.
I love making something that visually amazing and effectively telling information to
the viewer, and *Front End Development* is one of many ways to do such a thing.

Besides of that, I have an interest about *E-learning*.
The main reason why I choose to study Computer Science
is because someday in the future I can contribute to a E-learning project/platform, because I’ve enjoyed
using one of those project when I was in high school and wasn’t satisfied with conventional education
system in my own school.

Yeah, that’s all a brief introduction about my self.
