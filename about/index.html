  <p>My name is <strong>Jahns Michael</strong>. You can call me <strong>Jahns</strong> or <strong>Michael</strong>.
I’m currently studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> at <strong>Universitas Indonesia</strong>.
I have so much interests for <em>Software Development</em> in general, but spesifically
<em>Front End Development</em>.
I love making something that visually amazing and effectively telling information to
the viewer, and <em>Front End Development</em> is one of many ways to do such a thing.</p><p>Besides of that, I have an interest about <em>E-learning</em>.
The main reason why I choose to study Computer Science
is because someday in the future I can contribute to a E-learning project/platform, because I’ve enjoyed
using one of those project when I was in high school and wasn’t satisfied with conventional education
system in my own school.</p><p>Yeah, that’s all a brief introduction about my self.</p>
